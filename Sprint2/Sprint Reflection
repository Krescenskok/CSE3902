As we worked on each task, we recorded our hours and moved the task to "in progress." Once we were done with the task, we recorded the total hours next to the task and put it in the "done" column.
As a team, we set deadlines for when we should start the project and when we should have it finished by. We also had multiple zoom calls throughout the 3 weeks to talk about our progress and to get an idea of how much was left of the project for each of us.
We believe that our method worked pretty well, however, we should meet more and have better communication to ensure that our code matches up or we are doing the correct processes.
