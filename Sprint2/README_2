# CSE3902
Sprint 2
Group 5

Player controls
Arrow and "wasd" keys should move Link and change his facing direction.
The 'z' and 'n' key should cause Link to attack using his sword.
Number keys (1, 2, 3, etc.) should be used to have Link use a different item (later this will be replaced with a menu system and 'x' and 'm' for the secondary item.
Use 'e' to cause Link to become damaged.
Block/obstacle controls
Use keys "t" and "y" to cycle between which block is currently being shown (i.e. think of the obstacles as being in a list where the game's current obstacle is being drawn, "t" switches to the previous item and "y" switches to the next)
all blocks should be stationary and should not interact with any other objects
Item controls
Use keys "u" and "i" to cycle between which item is currently being shown (i.e. think of the items as being in a list where the game's current item is being drawn, "u" switches to the previous item and "i" switches to the next)
Items should move and animate as they do in the final game, but should not interact with any other objects
Enemy/NPC (other character) controls
Use keys "o" and "p" to cycle between which enemy or npc is currently being shown (i.e. think of these characters as being in a list where the game's current character is being drawn, "o" switches to the previous item and "p" switches to the next)
characters should move, animate, fire projectiles, etc. as they do in the final game, but should not interact with any other objects
Other controls
Use 'q' to quit and 'r' to reset the program back to its initial state.

Andrew and Ann worked on all classes dealing with items
Krescens worked on all classes dealing with Link
Noah worked on all classes dealing with blocks
Yuan and JT worked on all classes dealing with enemies
Andrew merged the all the code together 

Code reviews and analysis were done with FxCop Analyzers

Code Review For Link:
No errors, 35 warnings, and 151 messages

Warnings:
- LinkPlayer: Member 'damagedStartTime' is explicitly initialized to its default value

  -> Removed the initialization
  
- MoveLeft/MoveRight/MoveUp/MoveDown: Member 'lastTime' is explicitly initialized to its default value

  -> Removed the initialization
  
The remaining warnings:
- In externally visible method 'Vector2 MoveDown.HandleMagicalRod(GameTime gameTime, Vector2 location)', validate parameter 'gameTime' is non-null before using it. If appropriate, throw an ArgumentNullException when the argument is null or add a Code Contract precondition asserting non-null argument.

  -> This warning message appears 21 times. It cannot be removed because gameTime is used to keep track of how often the program updates, but it will be null initially.
  
- Member 'i' is explicitly initialized to its default value

  -> i needs to be initialized because it's the index of the array of colors used for tinting when Link is damaged.
  
- Do not declare visible instance fields

  -> This warning message appears 4 times. These variables are protected, which are needed since it is only visible to "Movement" and all the classes that inherit it.
  
- Member 'loc' is explicitly initialized to its default value
- Member 'isAttacking' is explicitly initialized to its default value 
- Member 'isDamaged' is explicitly initialized to its default value 
- Member 'isStopped' is explicitly initialized to its default value 

  -> These initializations are all necessary for the different states that Link appears in




Code Analysis for Items:
0 errors, 0 warnings, 179 messages (many are repeated)

Messages:
>Private member currentFrame can be removed as the value assigned to it is never read
Variable was left in to match with other similar classes - likely needs to be removed in future.

>Make field readonly
Many fields marked with this message need their values changed at some point in the code.

>Remove unused parameter spriteBatch
Leftover from the old functionality of ItemsCommand - will be used in a future change.
