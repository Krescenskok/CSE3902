Near the end of the sprint, write up a brief report on how your team performed this sprint, using the burndown chart from the board as the basis for discussion.
Feel free to also discuss your processes as a whole. Were any changes your made this sprint constructive or detrimental? Do you have any plans for doing things differently next sprint?

Our team performed pretty well during this sprint. We met up via zoom when it was assigned and listed out all the bugs from the previous sprint as well as the
tasks we needed to complete for this sprint. We also figured out when we were all available just in case we needed to meet up again and work together on the project.
For this sprint, we left the tasks open ended and let each member choose what task they wanted to work on, working to complete all of them. We used trello for our
task board to see what needed to be done first (fixing bugs from sprint 3) and things that could wait till later.
