Our team performed really well during this sprint. We met up via zoom when it was assigned and listed all the bugs from the previous sprint as well as the extra
stuff we wanted to add for the final sprint. We listed as many ideas as we could to see how many things we could complete. For this sprint, we left tasks open ended
so that each member could experiment with the different ideas and explore new ones if they wished to do so. We used trello for our task board to see what needed to 
be done first (fixing bugs) and the things that could wait till later.

It was detrimental to our sprint and group that all of us had assignments and projects due the same day that this sprint was due, due to it being the last day of
class. This made all of us extremely busy, along with having to work as well. It was constructive for our group that we kept each other updated with the things
that we were working on and had multiple zoom meetings so that we could help each other fix the bugs. We planned to have most of the code done by Thursday, December
3rd, so that we could use the 4th for any last minute fixes and focus on the reflection, analyses, and ReadMe. Since this is the last sprint, we do not plan to do 
anything differently. However, if there was another sprint, we would probably choose to keep the same method because it worked out pretty well for us.

For this sprint, these are the tasks that were completed by each member:
- JT:
  - Implementing game states
