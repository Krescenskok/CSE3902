Feel free to also discuss your processes as a whole. Were any changes your made this sprint constructive or detrimental? Do you have any plans for doing things differently next sprint?

Our team performed pretty well during this sprint. We met up via zoom when it was assigned and listed out all the bugs from the previous sprint as well as the
tasks we needed to complete for this sprint. We also figured out when we were all available just in case we needed to meet up again and work together on the project.
For this sprint, we left the tasks open ended and let each member choose what task they wanted to work on, working to complete all of them. We used trello for our
task board to see what needed to be done first (fixing bugs from sprint 3) and things that could wait till later. 

It was detrimental to our sprint and group that the hackathon was this past weekend, so some of us were busy and weren't able to work on the project. We didn't
work together as much until the end, which probably wasn't helpful. It was constructive that we set up a new task board (trello) which was much easier to move, and
had a better design. We also set up a google docs burndown chart, so we could record our hours each day and see everyone's process through the project. We did have
a zoom call near the end, and the day of the due date so that we could work together to finish up merging everything and make sure that there were no errors.
