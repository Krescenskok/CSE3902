- Implement collsion handling for items
JT: 
- Create an artificial level
- Created individual rooms of the dungeon, each with its own subset of objects
- Clean up code for enemies
- Created collision classes and template
- Room handling

- Implement collision handling for Link
- Create projectile animation for Link and items
- Sprint reflection
- Sprint ReadMe


As we worked on each task, we recorded our hours and moved the task to "in progress." Once we were done with the task, we recorded the total hours next 
to the task and put it in the "done" column.

When the sprint was assigned, we set up a zoom meeting to discuss what needed to be done for this sprint. We assigned certain tasks to each group member and 
discussed the next time we would meet to talk about what was left, or if any of us needed help. We met multiple times via zoom to ensure that we were doing the
right implementations. 

Since this sprint was more heavily focused on handling with each object, it was constructive to set up meetings often and discuss how the objects would work
when they collided. Another thing that was constructive for our group is that we figured out how to use the GitHub branches/repository. By using different
branches, it became easier to merge our code together and see the commmits that our group members submitted. This allowed us to also reference other's code and
ensure that our own code would work with everyone else's.

It was detrimental for our group because we couldn't meet in person (like previous classes could) because it was harder to communicate and
ask questions. It would've been much easier if we met in person to actually interact with the project code to find mistakes if there were any, rather than just 
watching a group member share their screen and try to figure out what was going on.
