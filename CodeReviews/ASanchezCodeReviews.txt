Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

It's very clear what each message printed to the screen is meant to inform the user of. 
The vector coordinates are magic numbers, so they are not as readable as they could be, however.
In addition, having a separate line for each message assists in reading the spacing of the messages as they would
appear in game. The code is concise and clear with no confusingly named variables.

Specific comments on code quality:

Very clear and obvious what the code is doing, clearly named variables and good whitespace distribution.
Additionally, there's little uneccessary code or bulk, has a specific, single purpose.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change

You could put the changing of the isPause variable within the executeCommand method instead of in the fields. Additionally, there are unecessary methods
that aren't being used
