Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
Variable names are descriptive, and the enum helped make things easier to read. The Method names do not follow capitalization conventions, however, but are descriptive and formatted in a way that it is easy to decipher their intended purpose.

Specific comments on code quality: 
The functionality of the code is well structured, but the positioning of the lines are hard coded coordinates and thus might present problems if the window size/dimensions were to change. The class does not seem to be implementing any interfaces or the like as well, even though it is structurally very similiar to other menu texture classes. Code quality could be improved between such classes if they did use an interface of sorts.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: 
Converting the XXXMenuTextures to all implement a sort of Menu Interface. It should not take much time to implement, would be a simple add to the game (just need to rearrange some things), and could possibly even shorten some of the code in other main menu-related classes.
