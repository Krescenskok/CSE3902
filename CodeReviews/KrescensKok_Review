Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: Easy to read, the doors are created and added associated to a specific number. Shows when a door is open/closed
and when the door is shown. The rooms are loaded, and then depending on where the door is located, that's where it's drawn. The door locations were then calculated
to see where the actual door sprites were supposed to be drawn.
