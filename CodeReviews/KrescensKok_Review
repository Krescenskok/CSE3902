Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: All of it is readable, the class starts off with creating variables having get/set properties. This class 
specifies the state that the game is in when it's actually running, and has everything updating. With updating, it also has everything drawing, with the specific layers of the sprites.

Specific comments on code quality: Good code quality, doesn't have very many lines which helps to identify bugs. This class has high cohesion because everything 
in the class deals with the state that the game is in, overall (credits, win, inventory, etc..). There were debug statements that should've been taken out. There is
also enough whitespace, which helps view the code easier.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: Make a 
dictionary of all the state ID's, so that it would be easier to access.
