Specific comments on code quality:  Since everything is effiviently put into its own class, the code has great quality.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: If were to add some sort of armor to the enemies which change the health, this code could easily accomodate for that by changing the HP max.
