Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

All of the variables use a good naming convention and are sorted by their type. The method names are descriptive,
and a dictionary is used for the map location sprites, which makes accessing each sprite easy to understand. Some of 
the logic in the Draw method is hard to understand because it uses a lot of if else and loops without function names.

Name of the .cs file being reviewed: InventoryMap.cs

Specific comments on code quality:

Each method is relatively short. The logic in InitializeMap is split up into short and simple for loops, and
there is a low use of magic numbers. The use of a Dictionary allows for lower time complexity when drawing each of the individualRoomSprites.


A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

A hypothetical change would be adding another dungeon. It would be hard to support that change because this code is based on only one map. Another method would need
to be added for initializing the map for each dungeon, and also make another InventoryMapSprite or allow for it to be constructed with a different texture.
