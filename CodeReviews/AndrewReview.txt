Specific comments on code quality:
Uses the ICollider interface, so helps standardize implementations well.
Is checking using magic strings which is not the best.
Otherwise, is well written.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
Maybe have a separate class that contains all the string constants that the Dodongo interacts with. 
Would be easy to add, but might seem unnecessary.
