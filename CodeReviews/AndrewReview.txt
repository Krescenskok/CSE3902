Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

Very descriptive names, logic is easy to follow
It's very clear what each message printed to the screen is meant to inform the user of. 
The vector coordinates are magic numbers, so they are not as readable as they could be, however.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
