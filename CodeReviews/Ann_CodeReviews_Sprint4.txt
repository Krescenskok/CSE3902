Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
Variable names are very descriptive and state their purpose. Method names are also self-explanatory. Logic flows linearlly. Does not follow the capitalization convention for some method names however.

Specific comments on code quality: 
Has magic numbers lying around everywhere. 
Uses methods in order to get certain private fields. Might be better to turn them into get sets if those values need to be retrieved.

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change: 
Converting the methods that return values of the private variables into get sets. Would be fairly simple to implement and support and would not change much in the game implementation.
