This fileâ€™s propose is to manage items in player inventory including pick up and consume items and equip different weapons. Overall, the code is readable; its not difficult to tell propose of each line, like play sound effect, update inventory and data. One possible improvement could be using switch case to replace long if else statement in pickupitem if possible.

This file handles the minimap in game; methods and variables in the file are clear. The whole class has a clear structure such that it inutilities, update and draw. 
Suggestions: first for loop in initializeMap use number 18, It seem need to be replace by LASTROOM. Probably give const FIVE a different name if it shrinks InvetorySize.
