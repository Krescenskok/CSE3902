Team Performance Report - See Sprint3Burndown.png
Most of our team worked well throughout the duration of the sprint, 
however some of our team contributed most of their efforts nearing the end. 
This led to a crunch situation as we underestimated how long each task would 
take and had to spent a lot of time in the last few days coding. Going forward, 
our whole team should work together from the start of the sprint and try to work 
on it at a steady pace rather than waiting until the final week.
