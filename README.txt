Write up a document with useful information on your project. This might include: program controls, descriptions of known bugs that program has, 
and details of any tools or processes your team used that aren't explicitly required (for example, calculating and using Code Metrics as part of your design process)


Program controls are the same from last game:
- The arrow keys move link, along with wasd. 
- To attack, n or z is pressed, and to change weapons
- Numbers are used to swtich.
- e is used to show Link being damaged.
- u and i are still used to switch between items (this will later on be used for Link's inventory of items)
- o and p are still used to switch between enemies (this will be removed later on, just kept it to debug if needed)
- q is used to quit
- r is used to reset the game

For this sprint, we implemented collisions between all the different objects (blocks, items, Link, and enemies)
